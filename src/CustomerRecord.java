/*
A program is required to read a customer’s name, a purchase amount and a tax code.
        The tax code has been validated and will be one of the following:
        0  tax exempt (0%)
        1  state sales tax only (3%)
        2  federal and state sales tax (5%)
        3  special sales tax (7%)
        The program must then compute the sales tax and
            the total amount due, and print the customer’s name,
            purchase amount, sales tax and total amount due.

Pseudocode:
import Scanner
declare method
declare vars for scanner, 0 tax, state, fed and state, special tax,
    applicable tax, total due, customer name
print customer's name
    purchase amount
    sales tax
    total amount
